Hate-Speech Detection Model

The hate speech detection model is designed to identify and classify hate speech in text data. Its purpose is to help online platforms and social media networks identify and moderate hate speech content to create a safer and more inclusive online environment.

Project Overview
This project involves building and training a machine learning model that can detect hate speech in text data. The approach includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training a classification model. This repository contains all the code and resources used to create, test, and deploy the model.

Key Features
Text Preprocessing: Removes noise and tokenizes text data.
Feature Extraction: Used  TF-IDF 
Model Training: Model was trained using Decision Tree 
Evaluation Metrics: F1-score,accuracy and confusion matrix.
